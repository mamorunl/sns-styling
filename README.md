# Styling override for the SNS Bank Website.

Note that this styling is purely for own use. I pushed it to github so I won't lose it. The current styling is horrible IMO and 
that's why I have created my own. 

Note: This styling is NOT made responsive. I feel that it is impossible to do that with the current classes and ids that the website 
builder has used.
